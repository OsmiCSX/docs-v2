But now, you can switch your app to `light`, `dark`, or use `system appearance` from user device. To get know more about this feature, check the documentation [here](https://osmicsx.dev/docs/appearance/dark-theme)\\n\\n## More Variable to be Customize\\nWe also add **Line Height**, **Letter Spacing**, and **Shadow** to `CustomTheme`. Now it can be customize as you want."},{"id":"2021/07/04/official-release-v0-6","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/07/04/official-release-v0-6","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-04-official-release-v0-6.md","title":"Official Release v0.6","description":"It has been 8 months since last update v0.5.1.

After preparing carefully, we finally develop a new version of OsmiCSX and complete on July 2021. So, what\'s new inside OsmiCSX v0.6 ?\\n\\n## Typescript Migration\\nWe finally migrate to typescript, we hope by this migration more people can contribute to this project. And also if you found something that not best practice in our typescript migration, don\'t hesitate to contribute \ud83e\udd42\\n\\n## Colors Improvement\\n### Extend Color Palettes\\nLike TailwindCSS, we added more color palettes. Now every color has a 50 value.\\nExample:\\n```javascript\\napply(\\"bg-red-50\\")\\n```\\n\\n### Colors Opacity\\nWe also add new features like TailwindCSS, colors opacity. Now you can add color opacity for Background Color, Border Color, and Text Color\\nExample:\\n```javascript\\napply(\\"bg-red-500 bg-opacity-50\\")\\napply(\\"text-blue-500 text-opacity-25\\")\\n```\\n\\n## Custom Theme Enhancement\\nWe created a new algorithm for Custom Theme. With this algorithm, you just need to define small pre-defined styles on your custom theme. Take a look at our new custom theme rules :\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  colors: {\\n    // custom colors\\n  },\\n  spacing: {\\n    // custom spacing\\n  },\\n  border: {\\n    width: {\\n\\t// border width\\n    },\\n    radius: {\\n\\t// border radius\\n    }\\n  },\\n  font: {\\n    family: {\\n\\t// font family\\n    },\\n    size: {\\n\\t// font size\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd here\'s a usage example:\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  // this will automatically generate background color, border color, and text color\\n  colors: {\\n    primary: \\"#f56565\\",\\n    secondary: \\"rgba(107, 114, 128, --osmi-opacity)\\"\\n  },\\n  // this will automatically generate margin, padding, top, right, left, bottom\\n  spacing: {\\n    \\"30\\": 120\\n  },\\n  // generate border width and radius\\n  border: {\\n    width: {\\n      \\"30\\": 120\\n    },\\n    radius: {\\n      \\"super-xl\\": 120\\n    }\\n  },\\n  // generate font family & font size\\n  font: {\\n    family: {\\n      \\"font-regular\\": \\"OpenSans-Regular\\"\\n    },\\n    size: {\\n      \\"xxl\\": 40\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Dark & Light Theme\\nFinally, we can support the dark theme, you don\'t need to manually check if the mobile device is using a dark theme or not. We do it for you. You just need to tell us which color you want to use if the device is using a dark theme.\\n\\nBy using prefix dark: and then following with the type of color (background/border/text)\\nExample:\\n```javascript\\napply(\\"bg-white dark:gray-900\\")\\n```\\n\\nIt means that the default/light background will use `white` and for the dark them it will use `gray-900`"}]}')}}]);
