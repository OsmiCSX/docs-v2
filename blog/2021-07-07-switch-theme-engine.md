OsmiCSX has added dark theme support in **v0.6** release, but we forget to add the switcher method. So, today we release a new patch for OsmiCSX. Let's take a look

## Appearance Switcher
Previously we only able to use dark theme from system appearance. But now, you can switch your app to `light`, `dark`, or use `system appearance` from user device. To get know more about this feature, check the documentation [here](https://osmicsx.dev/docs/appearance/dark-theme)

## More Variable to be Customize
We also add **Line Height**, **Letter Spacing**, and **Shadow** to `CustomTheme`. Now it can be customize as you want.
